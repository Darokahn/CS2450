## Engineering Journal
I'm planning on using this journal to document my personal projects, school assignments, and aspirational projects.

Personal projects are ones which I must complete for the sake of some non-academic interest; whether that be pure experimental curiosity or some professional requirement.

School assignments are self-descriptive; whatever tasks I should accomplish for course work.

Aspirational projects are ones that I have not started but seem like cool ideas to me.


The personal project I'm currently working on is a Scratch VM that I can use to run scratch projects on embedded hardware, namely an esp32.
I'm currently struggling with it, and it's hard to even put my finger on why. I think I'm floundering a bit when it comes to identifying and isolating the requirements of each component.
I want to be able to test components going forward, but I'm at a stage in development where each component depends on the complete output of others to be fully testable.

I can spoof the ideal output for one component and plug that in while the true component is incomplete; however, this requires a lot of thinking about the organization the project depends on.
A lot of those details are unresolved, and remain difficult to resolve. The problem, I think, is a tangle of perceived unresolved dependencies. Since nothing feels solidly defined, and since everything depends on something else, it's hard to pick a problem to tackle and fully define.

The school assignments I need to finish are:

- This journal (2450)
- Notes and AI Chat (2810)
- Questions 3 (3005)

Questions 3 should be done, I just need to submit the github link.
I'm annoyed with the notes requirement in 2810, but I think I took some decent enough notes, so it should be okay.

I have a few aspirational projects on my mind. These are things I'd like to start when I have nothing on my plate. Several of them came from brainstorming sessions with my team in this Software Engineering class.
- Webpage social media site, where each post by a user is a 500x500px view into a custom website. A social media site oriented toward technical users, where creativity and interactivity are the blood of posts.
- A dating app for CS students at Utah Tech... Codegrindr
- An AI bytecode-like instruction format designed to dispatch tasks to AI in atomic ways, leaving no complete task to a single agent that wouldn't be capable of an accurate answer.
- An NES emulator
- A simple server that monitors all my email accounts and pushes new emails to a small screen in my room.
